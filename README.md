# Cancer_Fundraiser_Website

Using FIGMA , We made a sample Website for 'Relay for Life' , A Cancer Research Fundraiser. We believe in spreading awarness about this event ( A fundraiser walk) so that more momey can be collected and be used towards Cancer Resarch. 

In our website we have included the basic and important features like , 

1) Easy donate button
2) Tracking how much donation has been made
3) Newsletters so that people are upto date on events 
4) An about us Page where people can learn more about relay for life
